# About

The **meltwater contribution** from snow and ice in mountainous regions plays a critical role in **sustaining life downstream**, supporting potable water security, agriculture, industry, hydropower generation and mining, especially in the current regime of climate change. 

## Overall Objective 
To effectively address this challenge, **SNOWCOP leverages the full potential of the European Union Copernicus data and infrastructure** to provide novel **snow water equivalent (SWE) and ice melting rate maps with high spatio-temporal resolution**, suitable to monitor meltwater dynamics in complex mountainous terrains.

## Methodology 
Cutting-edge methods will be employed to extract **valuable information about snow and glacier from satellite data**, which will then be **assimilated into a physically based model for snow and ice water equivalent estimation**. The model will be run in a hindcast mode, generating reanalysis data spanning **the past 20+ years at daily resolution**. Notably, the proposed approach yields SWE maps over a **50-m pixel size**, achieving an unprecedented level of spatial detail for the vast area of the extra-tropical Andes Cordillera.

## CDSE
The [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE)][CDSE] infrastructure, which houses both processing facilities and a comprehensive data repository, serves as the backbone for this project. **CDSE will be populated with all the necessary codes, in-situ data, and third-party space data, enabling the seamless extraction, processing, and analysis of mountain cryosphere-related information**. To further enhance accessibility and utilization, a user-friendly and standardized API and a robust dissemination strategy will be implemented in collaboration with key public authorities in Europe and South America. This strategic approach aims to **attract new users from both the scientific and commercial sectors**, ensuring that the projectâ€™s valuable data and insights reach a broad audience.

## EGNSS snow stations
SNOWCOP will leverage innovative **snow stations powered by EGNSS technology** to reinforce in-situ measurements of SWE and liquid water content (LWC). These stations will be positioned on locations that **optimally represent the snowmelt dynamics within a specific catchment** based on the project generated reanalysis data.

## Impacts
Focusing on the critical Andes Mountain range, where meltwater serves as a vital lifeline for millions of people but remains poorly monitored, this initiative **leverages the expertise of the International Copernicus partners at the University of Chile**. Through this collaboration, we tackle shared challenges faced by mountain regions globally, **developing replicable solutions that unlock new opportunities for both local and European communities**.
